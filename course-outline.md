They often struggle with large data volumes, require time-consuming manual refresh processes, and produce static visualizations that are difficult to collaborate on.9 Modern BI platforms like Power BI are designed to solve these specific problems through scalable data handling, automated data refresh, and the creation of dynamic, interactive reports.10Lesson 0.2: Course Overview and Target AudienceConcept: This curriculum follows a three-part structure, guiding a student from "Beginner" to "Analyst" and finally to "Master." A "Case Study Scenario" (e.g., analyzing sales for a retail company) will be used throughout the course to provide real-world context.2Discussion: The course is designed for any professional who works with data, regardless of their current title.11 It is particularly impactful for "Excel power users" who are seeking to advance their analytical capabilities beyond the constraints of spreadsheets.11 It is also the ideal learning path for aspiring Data Analysts 12, Business Analysts, and IT professionals who need to leverage data for decision-making.Lesson 0.3: Prerequisites: What Do You Really Need?Concept: While there are no formal prerequisites to begin 13, a baseline of data literacy is highly beneficial.14Discussion: Certain existing skills can be considered "accelerators" for the learning process. A strong familiarity with Microsoft Excel, especially functions, formulas, and Pivot Tables, provides a significant advantage.11 This is because core components of Power BI, such as Power Query and the DAX formula language, are shared with modern Excel. Other helpful, though not required, concepts include a basic understanding of databases (e.g., the concept of a table) and data visualization (e.g., the purpose of a bar chart).11Lesson 0.4: The BI Landscape: Power BI vs. Tableau vs. ExcelConcept: This lesson positions Power BI within its competitive landscape to establish why it is a critical tool to learn.16Discussion: The choice of a BI tool is not purely technical; it is strategic.Table: BI Tool Comparison (Updated Nov 2025)FeatureExcelTableauPower BIStrengthAd-hocViz-firstEnd-to-End + Fabric [20]DataSmall [16]LargeUnlimited (OneLake) [21]CostFree$$$Free Desktop + Pro $10/moAIBasicLimitedCopilot GAPart 1: The Power BI Beginner – From Blank Canvas to First ReportModule 1: The Power BI Ecosystem: Components and SetupLesson 1.1: The Three Parts of Power BIConcept: Power BI is not a single program but a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together.8Discussion: A student's foundational mental model must include these three components and their interactions (including cloud vs. on-premises options 10):Power BI Desktop: A free, standalone Windows application.12 This is the primary "authoring" tool. All development—connecting to data, transforming, modeling, and building reports—happens here.10Power BI Service: The cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering.12 This is the "collaboration and sharing" hub. Reports from Desktop are published to the Service to be shared, collaborated on, and assembled into dashboards.10Power BI Mobile: Native apps for iOS and Android devices.22 This is the "consumption" tool, allowing users to access and interact with their reports and dashboards on the go.10Table: Power BI Ecosystem ComponentsComponentPrimary UseKey ActionEnvironmentPower BI DesktopAuthoring & DevelopmentBuild ReportsWindows PC / ARMPower BI ServiceSharing & CollaborationCreate DashboardsCloud (Browser) 10Power BI MobileConsumption & ViewingAccess AnywherePhone/Tablet 22Lesson 1.2: Installation and Setup (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Installing the free Power BI Desktop application.23Discussion: There are two primary installation methods 24:Microsoft Store (Recommended): This version updates automatically in the background, ensuring the user always has the latest features.24Direct Download (Executable): This version requires manual updates but offers more control for enterprise environments.24Note for Mac Users: Power BI Desktop is a Windows-only application. Mac users must utilize a virtual machine environment, such as Parallels, to run a Windows instance.25Note for ARM Users (New in 2025): As of September/October 2025, Power BI Desktop is now supported to run natively on ARM-based Windows PCs.Lesson 1.3: Post-Install: Enabling Preview FeaturesConcept: Power BI is updated on a monthly basis. Many of the most powerful new features are first released in "preview" and must be manually enabled by the user.1Discussion: A critical first step for any new user is to navigate to File > Options and settings > Options > Preview features.1 Enabling these features (e.g., the new Model Explorer 26 or On-object interaction 1) not only provides access to the latest tools but also reinforces a core concept: the tool is in a constant state of evolution, and staying current is essential.Lesson 1.4: Tour of the Power BI Desktop InterfaceConcept: Understanding the three main "views" within Power BI Desktop is key to navigating the workflow.26Discussion:Report View (Canvas): This is the default view, a blank canvas where visualizations are created and arranged. This is the "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor for the final report.28Data View: This view resembles a spreadsheet. It allows the user to inspect the raw data after it has been loaded into the model. It is also where one can create calculated columns.28Model View: This is the "engine room" or "diagram" view. It provides a visual representation of all tables in the data model and is where relationships between them are created and managed.28These three views directly correspond to the BI workflow: one Models the data (Model View), Inspects the data (Data View), and Visualizes the data (Report View).Module 2: Data Acquisition – Connecting to Your WorldLesson 2.1: The "Get Data" ExperienceConcept: The "Get Data" function is the universal starting point for all Power BI projects. It provides access to hundreds of different data sources, from simple files to cloud databases and web services.8Lesson 2.2: Connecting to Files (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Connecting to the most common flat-file data sources.32Discussion: This lab will walk through connecting to:Excel Workbooks (.xlsx): Power BI can connect to Excel tables and worksheets.32 This lesson will also cover best practices for structuring Excel data (e.g., using proper tables, avoiding merged cells) to make it ready for Power BI.Text/CSV Files (.csv): A ubiquitous format for data export.32PDF: Power BI can extract data from tables found within PDF documents.32Lesson 2.3: Connecting to DatabasesConcept: Connecting to relational databases, which form the backbone of most enterprise data systems.31Discussion: The primary example will be SQL Server.10 This lesson will explain the concepts of a Server Name and Database Name, as well as the different authentication modes (e.g., Windows vs. SQL Server credentials).34Lesson 2.4: Connecting to Web and Cloud ServicesConcept: Acquiring data directly from online sources.31Discussion: A simple demonstration will involve the "From Web" connector to pull tabular data from a web page (e.g., a table from a Wikipedia article).35 This will also introduce the existence of connectors for cloud services like SharePoint folders 32 and Azure SQL Databases.10Lesson 2.5: Understanding Connection Modes (A Critical Choice)Concept: When connecting to a data source, the user must choose how the data is accessed. This choice has profound and lasting implications for performance, data freshness, and their trade-offs.13Discussion:Import: This is the default, most common, and highest-performance mode. Power BI makes a copy of the data and stores it in its highly compressed in-memory (VertiPaq) engine inside the .pbix file. Reports are very fast, but the data is only as fresh as the last refresh.DirectQuery: Power BI does not copy the data. Instead, it sends queries directly to the source database in real-time.10 This is ideal for extremely large datasets or when "live" data is a strict requirement. The trade-off is that report performance is now dependent on the speed of the underlying database.Composite: This mode allows a "mix" of both, enabling a developer to Import dimension tables while using DirectQuery for a massive fact table.10This choice is the first and most critical performance decision a developer makes. The choice of "Import" necessitates learning about data refresh schedules and gateways (covered in Module 12). The choice of "DirectQuery" necessitates learning about query optimization and database performance (covered in Module 13).Table: Connection Mode Comparison (Import vs. DirectQuery)ModeData LocationReport PerformanceData FreshnessCommon Use CaseImportStored inside Power BI fileVery FastStale (Snapshot)Most standard reportsDirectQueryStays in source databaseDepends on source databaseReal-time (Live)Massive datasets; real-time needsModule 3: Data Transformation – The Power Query EditorLesson 3.1: Introduction to Power Query (The ETL Mindset)Concept: After connecting to data, the "Navigator" dialog asks to "Load" or "Transform." The best practice is to always select "Transform" first.35 This opens the Power Query Editor.7Discussion: Power Query is the "data kitchen" for Power BI. It is a visual Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tool used to clean, shape, and prepare data for analysis.13 The UI consists of the Ribbon, the list of queries, and the Applied Steps pane.37 This pane is the core of Power Query's power: every transformation is recorded as a step that is re-played every time the data is refreshed, making the cleaning process fully automated and non-destructive.38Lesson 3.2: Basic Table Transformations (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Applying the most common steps to clean messy data.36Discussion: Using a sample dataset, this lab will cover:Choosing and Removing ColumnsFiltering Rows (e.g., removing null or blank values) 38Sorting Data"Use First Row as Headers" (promoting headers) 13Lesson 3.3: Data Cleaning and FormattingConcept: Fixing "dirty" data to make it usable for analysis.8Discussion:Replace Values: Correcting misspellings or standardizing categories.38Change Data Type: Converting columns from text to whole numbers, or to dates.13Handle Errors: Removing or replacing error values.38Fill Down/Up: A powerful tool for "un-merging" cells from messy Excel exports.Split and Merge Columns: Combining or separating text data (e.g., First Name and Last Name).38Lesson 3.4: Shaping Data – Pivot and UnpivotConcept: Restructuring data to be suitable for analysis.38Discussion:Unpivot: This is a crucial operation. It transforms wide data (e.g., columns for Jan, Feb, Mar) into tall data (one "Month" column, one "Value" column). The tall format is the correct, tidy format for BI tools.Pivot: The reverse operation, used less frequently.Lesson 3.5: Advanced Shaping (Conditional Columns & Grouping)Concept: Using Power Query's UI to perform more advanced logic.37Discussion:Conditional Columns: Creating new columns based on IF/THEN logic (e.g., categorizing sales amounts into "High," "Medium," or "Low").39Grouping and Aggregating: Performing a "Group By" operation to summarize data before it's even loaded into the model (e.g., calculating total sales per region).37Lesson 3.6: Introduction to ParametersConcept: Using Power Query parameters to make queries dynamic.7Discussion: Introduce the concept of parameters to easily change inputs like a file path or a start date, making the query reusable.Lesson 3.7: Combining Queries: Merge vs. Append (A Critical Concept)Concept: Combining multiple tables (queries) into a single, unified table.13 The distinction between these two operations is fundamental.40Discussion:Append: Stacks data vertically, adding more rows.42 This is used when you have files of the same structure (e.g., Sales_2023 and Sales_2024). The tables must have the same column headers to append correctly.40Merge: Joins data horizontally, adding more columns.40 This is analogous to a VLOOKUP in Excel. It is used to join two different tables (e.g., a Sales table and a Product table) based on a common key (e.g., ProductID). This lesson will also introduce Join Kinds (e.g., Inner, Left Outer).40Table: Merge vs. Append 40OperationAnalogyData DirectionResultUse CaseAppendStackingVerticalMore RowsCombining Sales_2023 and Sales_2024MergeVLOOKUPHorizontalMore ColumnsAdding Product Names to a Sales tableLesson 3.8: Introduction to the Advanced Editor (The M Language)Concept: This lesson serves to demystify the code behind Power Query, not to teach it (yet).45Discussion: By clicking the "Advanced Editor" button 38, a user can see that every click made in the UI has been writing code in a functional language called "M".46 This plants the seed for advanced work in Module 15. The let and in statements 48 will be shown, linking each "Applied Step" to a line of code.Lesson 3.9: Close & ApplyConcept: The final step in the Power Query Editor.Discussion: Clicking "Close & Apply" executes all the applied steps, closes the editor, and loads the clean, transformed data into the Power BI data model.36Module 4: Data Visualization – Building Your First ReportLesson 4.1: Introduction to the Visualizations PaneConcept: The "Fields" pane contains the data tables and columns, while the "Visualizations" pane contains the chart types.28Discussion: The core workflow for building a report is: 1. Select a visual type (e.g., Bar chart) from the Visualizations pane. 2. Drag data fields from the Fields pane into the visual's "wells" (e.g., X-axis, Y-axis, Legend).28Lesson 4.2: Creating Core Visuals (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Building the most common and effective chart types.39Discussion: This lab will guide students to build:Bar/Column Chart: For categorical comparisons (e.g., Sales by Category).Line Chart: For trends over time (e.g., Sales by Month).Pie/Treemap: For part-to-whole relationships.Map: For visualizing geographical data (e.g., Sales by State).Lesson 4.3: Using Slicers for InteractivityConcept: Slicers are on-page visual filters (like a dropdown or list) that allow the end-user to interact with and filter the entire report page.49Lab: Add a "Year" slicer and a "Region" slicer. Demonstrate how selecting a value in a slicer dynamically filters all other visuals on the page.Lesson 4.4: Displaying Key Metrics: Cards, KPIs, and GaugesConcept: Highlighting the most important, single-number metrics.Discussion: Use the "Card" visual to display a large, single number like "Total Sales".50 Briefly introduce the "KPI" and "Gauge" visuals, which are designed to track a metric against a target or goal.2Lesson 4.5: Basic Report FormattingConcept: Applying basic design principles for a professional look.Discussion: This includes aligning visuals on the canvas, adding clear titles, and applying built-in report themes to ensure color and font consistency.51 This module provides a "quick win": by its end, the student has completed the entire BI workflow (Get -> Transform -> Visualize) 8, building a strong sense of accomplishment.Capstone Project 1: Beginner's End-to-End ReportProject Brief: 8Dataset: A single, moderately-messy Excel file (e.g., a Superstore Sales dataset).2Task 1 (Get Data): Connect to the Excel file.32Task 2 (Transform): Use the Power Query Editor to clean the data. This must include fixing data types, removing nulls, and using "Unpivot" to tidy a set of columns.38Task 3 (Visualize): Build a single-page dashboard that includes:"Total Sales" (Card visual) 50"Sales over Time" (Line Chart)"Sales by Product Category" (Bar Chart)"Sales by Region" (Map visual)Interactive filters for "Year" and "Product Category" (Slicers).49Task 4 (Fabric Integration): Publish the report to a Fabric-enabled workspace and export the data to a OneLake Lakehouse.Learning Outcome: The student has successfully built and can interact with a complete BI report, reinforcing all lessons from Part 1.Part 2: The Power BI Analyst – Modeling, DAX, and DesignModule 5: Data Modeling – The Relational FoundationLesson 5.1: Why Data Modeling is the Most Critical SkillConcept: This module addresses the limitations of the single-table model built in Part 1. Data modeling involves creating a relational model of multiple, interconnected tables.8Discussion: A user will eventually try to add more data (e.g., Product Details) to their single Sales table. Their first instinct will be to use "Merge" in Power Query, creating one massive, wide, and inefficient table. This makes DAX formulas complex and report performance slow. This module provides the solution: A proper data model is the most important form of performance tuning. A bad model (one big table) is slow and difficult to use. A good model (a star schema) is fast, efficient, and makes writing DAX simple.Lesson 5.2: Understanding Fact vs. Dimension TablesConcept: A data model is composed of two primary types of tables: facts and dimensions.58Discussion:Fact Tables: These tables contain numbers and events (e.g., Sales Transactions). They are characterized by being "narrow and long," containing many rows of transactions and keys that link to dimensions.60Dimension Tables: These tables contain the context and attributes (e.g., Product List, Customer List, Date Calendar). They are characterized by being "wide and short," with fewer rows but many descriptive columns.60Table: Fact vs. Dimension Tables 60CharacteristicFact TableDimension TableContentNumerical measures, keys (e.g., SalesAmount)Descriptive attributes (e.g., ProductName, Color)ShapeLong and narrow (many rows)Short and wide (many columns)ExampleFact_Sales, Fact_InventoryDim_Product, Dim_Customer, Dim_DateRoleStores what is being measuredProvides context; used for filtering and slicingLesson 5.3: Designing a Star Schema (The BI Gold Standard)Concept: The Star Schema is the target design for a Power BI data model.58Discussion: This schema is visualized as a single, central Fact Table (like Sales) connected directly to multiple Dimension Tables (like Dim_Product, Dim_Customer, Dim_Date).66 It is called a "star" because of this hub-and-spoke appearance.Contrast with Snowflake Schema: A "Snowflake" schema is one where dimensions are normalized (e.g., Dim_Product links to Dim_Category).66 Unlike traditional SQL databases, Power BI's in-memory engine (VertiPaq) prefers a star schema. The snowflake design creates longer relationship filter chains, which can be less efficient in Power BI.64 The best practice is to denormalize dimensions into a single, wide table.Model Best Practices: This lesson will also cover model best practices, such as hiding unnecessary fields (e.g., key columns) from the Report View and creating date or geographical hierarchies for easier drill-down.70Lesson 5.4: Creating and Managing Relationships (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Using the Model View to visually connect the tables into a star schema.71Discussion: This lab involves "dragging and dropping" the key column from the dimension table (e.g., ProductID from Dim_Product) onto the foreign key in the fact table (e.g., ProductID in Fact_Sales) to create the relationship line.71Best Practice: A professional developer should go to File > Options and disable "Autodetect new relationships".71 Manually building relationships is the only way to guarantee the model is correct and that the developer understands their own data.Lesson 5.5: Cardinality and Cross-Filter DirectionConcept: Configuring the rules that govern the relationship flow.71Discussion:Cardinality 73: Describes the uniqueness of the values in the joined columns.One-to-Many (1:*): The ideal and most common type. One product in Dim_Product has many transactions in Fact_Sales.73One-to-One (1:1): Rare. These tables can often be merged into one.73Many-to-Many (:): Complex and can cause ambiguity. Best practice is to avoid this by creating a "bridge" table.74Cross-Filter Direction 72: Controls how filters flow between tables.Single: The default and best practice. Filters flow "downhill" from the "one" side (Dimension) to the "many" side (Fact).Both: Allows filters to flow "uphill." While powerful, it can create ambiguity and slow performance. It should be used sparingly and with specific intent.75Lesson 5.6: Advanced Modeling Concepts (PL-300)Concept: Handling more complex modeling scenarios required for the PL-300 exam.76Discussion:Role-Playing Dimensions: Using a single dimension table (like Dim_Date) to filter a fact table on multiple foreign keys (e.g., OrderDateKey, ShipDateKey). This requires one active and multiple inactive relationships.64Calculated Tables: Using DAX (e.g., CALENDARAUTO(), SUMMARIZE()) to create new tables within the data model itself, rather than in Power Query.76Module 6: Introduction to DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)Lesson 6.1: What is DAX?Concept: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is the formula language used in Power BI, as well as in SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular and Power Pivot in Excel.78Discussion: It is not a query language like SQL, nor is it a cell-based language like Excel. It is a functional language that operates on entire tables and columns within the data model.77Lesson 6.2: The Core Concept: Calculated Columns vs. MeasuresConcept: This is the single-most critical, and most-confused, concept for new DAX learners.77 A simple formula like "Total Price" ([Quantity] * [Unit Price]) can be created in two different ways. The choice has massive implications.Calculated Column 83:How: Created in the Data View or Model View.86Evaluation: Calculated at data refresh. Computed row-by-row based on the "Row Context".83Storage: The results are stored in the model, consuming RAM and increasing the file size.83Use Case: When the result is needed in a slicer, on an axis, or as a filter.83 (e.g., categorizing products by "High/Low" price).Measure 83:How: Created in the Report View, Data View, or Model View.Evaluation: Calculated at query time (when a visual renders). Computed on-the-fly based on the "Filter Context" of the visual.83Storage: Results are not stored. Consumes CPU at query time.83Use Case: For any aggregation that will appear in the "Values" area of a visual (e.g., Total Sales, Average Price).83The Golden Rule: A beginner from an Excel background will try to do everything in Calculated Columns, as it mimics an Excel table. This is the primary mistake. It leads to bloated, slow, and inflexible reports. The professional rule is: Use a Calculated Column only when you must. Use a Measure for everything else..83Table: Calculated Columns vs. Measures (Expanded) 83FeatureCalculated ColumnMeasureEvaluation ContextRow Context [81]Filter Context [81]When CalculatedAt Data Refresh [85]At Query Time (On-the-fly) [85]StorageConsumes RAM (stored in model) 84Consumes CPU (not stored) 84Primary UseSlicers, Axes, Filters, Row-level categorization 83Values in charts, KPIs, aggregations 83Common MistakeUsing for simple aggregations 83(Rarely the wrong choice)Lesson 6.3: Creating Calculated Columns (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Writing basic row-context DAX formulas in the Data View.77Lab: Create a Full Name column ([FirstName] & " " & [LastName]). Create a Price Category column using logical functions like IF and SWITCH.Lesson 6.4: Creating Measures (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Writing basic aggregation measures.77Lab:Total Sales = SUM(Sales)Avg. Price = AVERAGE(Sales[UnitPrice])Order Count = COUNT(Sales[OrderLineKey])Lesson 6.5: Implicit vs. Explicit MeasuresConcept: "Implicit" measures are created when a numeric column is dragged into a visual, and Power BI implicitly applies an aggregation (like SUM).77 "Explicit" measures are those created manually with DAX, as in the lab.77Best Practice: A professional developer always creates explicit measures. This provides central control, reusability, and clarity.84 Implicit measures should be disabled in the model settings.Lesson 6.6: Using Quick MeasuresConcept: Using Power BI's UI-driven "Quick Measures" gallery to auto-generate DAX for common calculations.70Discussion: Demonstrate creating a running total or percent of grand total using the Quick Measure tool, and then review the DAX code that Power BI generated. This is a powerful learning tool for beginners.Module 7: Intermediate DAX – Understanding Evaluation ContextLesson 7.1: The "Secret Sauce" of DAX: Evaluation ContextConcept: A DAX formula's result is not fixed; it depends on the context in which it is evaluated.87 There are two types of context.Lesson 7.2: Row Context (The "Current Row")Concept: A context that iterates through a table one row at a time.90Discussion: This context exists by default in Calculated Columns.83 This is why the formula [Quantity] * [Unit Price] works in a calculated column—it is evaluated for each row individually.Lesson 7.3: Filter Context (The "Current Cell")Concept: The set of all filters applied to a measure before it is calculated.87Discussion: Imagine a matrix visual with Total Sales in the Values, Region on Rows, and Year on Columns. The Total Sales value for the cell at the intersection of "East" and "2023" is calculated within a filter context of  = "East" AND  = 2023. Slicers, filters on other visuals, and the visual's own coordinates all contribute to this filter context.87Lesson 7.4: Iterator Functions (SUMX, AVERAGEX, MINX)Concept: Iterators, or "X-functions," are functions that create a row context within a measure, allowing for row-by-row calculations.76Discussion: This is the correct solution to the "Total Price" problem from Module 6. Instead of a memory-intensive calculated column, a professional creates a measure: Total Sales = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice]).83This formula instructs Power BI to:Go to the Sales table (within the current filter context).Iterate row-by-row (creating a row context).91For each row, calculate [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] and store the result in temporary memory.After iterating all rows, SUM up all the temporary results.3This provides the correct aggregation without bloating the model, adhering to the "Measures > Columns" golden rule.Module 8: Advanced DAX – Modifying Filter ContextLesson 8.1: The Most Important Function in DAX: CALCULATE()Concept: CALCULATE() is the most powerful and important function in DAX. It is the only function that can modify the filter context.90Syntax: CALCULATE( <expression>, <filter1>, <filter2>,... ).95Discussion: The first argument is the measure to be evaluated (e.g., ``). All subsequent arguments are new filters that are applied, which can override or add to the existing filter context.87Lab: Create East Sales = CALCULATE(, Customers = "East" ).94Lesson 8.2: Removing Filters with ALL()Concept: The ALL() function removes filters from a table or column.96 Its primary use is as a filter modifier inside CALCULATE().Discussion: This is the key to creating "Percent of Total" calculations.97Lab:Create All Region Sales = CALCULATE(, ALL(Customers) ). (This measure calculates the total sales for all regions, ignoring any filter on region).96Create % of Total Sales = DIVIDE(, ).97When placed in a matrix by Region, is filtered, but is not, yielding the correct percentage for each row.Lesson 8.3: Related ALL Functions: ALLEXCEPT(), ALLSELECTED()Concept: Nuanced versions of ALL() for more complex scenarios.95Discussion:ALLEXCEPT(Table, Column): Removes all filters from Table except for the filters on Column.98ALLSELECTED(): Removes the filter context from the visual, but respects filters coming from slicers or other visuals.Lesson 8.4: Context Transition (The Advanced Concept)Concept: When CALCULATE() is used inside a row context (such as in a calculated column), it performs "Context Transition".89Discussion: This complex but powerful mechanism transitions the current row's values into an equivalent filter context.89Example: Create a calculated column in the Customer table: Total Spend = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales)).98 For each row in the Customer table, context transition converts the CustomerKey into a filter, calculating the total sales for only that specific customer.Lesson 8.5: Advanced DAX Scenarios (USERELATIONSHIP)Concept: Solving complex modeling problems with DAX.Discussion:USERELATIONSHIP(): How to activate an inactive relationship in the model (e.g., Order Date vs. Ship Date) for a specific measure.76Lesson 8.6: Introduction to Visual Calculations (Oct 2025 GA)Concept: A new, simpler way to add calculations (like running totals or moving averages) directly on a visual, operating on the visual's data matrix rather than the full data model.Lab: Create a "Running Total" and a "Moving Average" using the new Visual Calculations interface, and compare this to the traditional DAX measure approach.Module 9: Specialized DAX – Time IntelligenceLesson 9.1: The Prerequisite: A Date TableConcept: DAX Time Intelligence functions will not work unless a proper, dedicated Date table exists in the model.76Discussion: This table must contain one row for every day in the desired range, with no gaps. It must be "Marked as Date Table" in the Model View. This table can be created in Power Query or using DAX (e.g., CALENDARAUTO()).Lesson 9.2: Year-to-Date (YTD) and Period-to-Date (Hands-On Lab)Concept: Calculating running totals for common time periods.99Lab: Create Sales YTD = TOTALYTD(, 'Date' ).99 This single function replaces complex, manual sum logic.Lesson 9.3: Prior Period ComparisonsConcept: Comparing performance to the equivalent period in the past.99Lab: Create Sales PY = CALCULATE(, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date') ).99 Also demonstrate DATEADD and PARALLELPERIOD for more flexible period shifts.Lesson 9.4: Calculating Year-over-Year (YoY) GrowthConcept: Combining the previous measures to create a key business KPI.Lab: Sales YoY % = DIVIDE( ( - ), ).Discussion: This lesson highlights the elegance of DAX. Three simple, reusable measures (, , ``) are stacked on top of each other to produce a sophisticated and critical insight.Lesson 9.5: Calculating Rolling AveragesConcept: Smoothing volatile data by calculating rolling averages (e.g., 3-month rolling average).Lab: Demonstrate using DATESINPERIOD inside a CALCULATE function to achieve a rolling average calculation.100Module 10: Report Design and Data StorytellingLesson 10.1: Principles of Effective Report Design & Chart Selection (UI/UX)Concept: A report can be analytically correct but visually useless. Good design (UI/UX) is not decoration; it is about guiding the user's eye and communicating insights with clarity.104Discussion: Core principles include 4:Chart Selection: When to use a bar chart (comparison) vs. a line chart (trend).109Visual Hierarchy: Place the most important information (e.g., KPIs) in the top-left, as users read in a "Z" pattern.104White Space: Do not clutter the page. White space is essential for readability.105Color with Purpose: Use color to highlight key information or signal status (e.g., red for bad), not just for decoration.105Consistency: Use consistent fonts, colors, and alignment throughout the report.105Mobile Design: Separately design a layout optimized for mobile consumption.105New Slicers: Use modern slicers like the "Button Slicer" (GA Oct 2025) for app-like cross-highlighting.Lesson 10.2: Advanced Interactivity: Drill-through PagesConcept: Drill-through allows a user to right-click a data point on a summary visual (e.g., "East" region) and navigate to a separate, detailed report page that is automatically filtered for the "East" region.107Lab: Create a "Summary" page and a "Region Details" page. Configure the "Region Details" page as a drill-through destination by dragging the Region field into the "Drill through" well.110 This can also be triggered from a button.111Lesson 10.3: Advanced Interactivity: Bookmarks and the Selection PaneConcept: Bookmarks capture and save the state of a report page, including all filters, slicers, and visual visibility states.49Discussion: The Selection Pane allows visuals to be shown or hidden. The Bookmarks pane saves these states.49 By assigning bookmarks to buttons, a developer can create custom, app-like navigation experiences.106 This is a core technique for "data storytelling," allowing the user to be guided through a narrative.113Lesson 10.4: Enhancing Visuals: Custom Report TooltipsConcept: The default hover-over tooltip is basic, showing only the data points.115 Power BI allows a developer to create an entirely new, small report page and use it as a custom tooltip.113Lab: Create a new page, set its type to "Tooltip." Add a small line chart and a KPI card. On the main report, select a visual and, in its formatting options, set the "Tooltip" type to "Report Page" and select the new tooltip page.117Lesson 10.5: Enhancing Visuals: Conditional FormattingConcept: Dynamically changing a visual's appearance (e.g., color) based on its data value.51Discussion: Demonstrate how to set the color of data bars in a table, or how to change the font color of a KPI card to be red or green based on a DAX measure.Lesson 10.6: The Art of Data StorytellingConcept: A report should be more than a collection of charts; it must be a narrative that leads to a decision.113Discussion: An effective data story follows a clear flow: 1. Set the Context (what are we looking at?). 2. Present the key Finding (e.g., "Sales are down 15%"). 3. Drill down to the "Why" (e.g., "...this is driven entirely by the East region"). 4. Propose an Action (e.g., "Investigate East region logistics").108 This can be enhanced with annotations and dynamic text measures.Lesson 10.7: Enhancing Reports with Custom VisualsConcept: Expanding Power BI's capabilities by importing new visuals from the AppSource marketplace.109Discussion: Demonstrate how to find, import, and use a popular custom visual (e.g., a Word Cloud or Sankey diagram) when standard visuals are not enough.NEW Module 11: Deep-Dive with AI Visuals & Insights (PL-300)Lesson 11.1: The Key Influencers VisualConcept: Using the Key Influencers visual to understand what factors drive a specific metric (e.g., "What influences a customer to churn?").55Lab: Use the Key Influencers visual to analyze what factors contribute to "High Profit" vs. "Low Profit" in the sales data.Lesson 11.2: The Decomposition Tree VisualConcept: Using the Decomposition Tree to perform root-cause analysis by breaking down a measure across multiple dimensions in a flexible, ad-hoc way.Lab: Create a Decomposition Tree to allow users to dynamically drill down into "Total Sales" by Region, then Category, then Sub-Category, to find the source of high or low sales.Lesson 11.3: Anomaly Detection & ForecastingConcept: Using the built-in AI features on line charts to automatically detect anomalies (unexpected spikes or dips) and to generate a time-series forecast.Lab: Apply Anomaly Detection to the "Sales over Time" line chart to spot sales outliers. Then, use the Forecasting feature to predict the next 3 months of sales.Capstone Project 2: Intermediate Interactive Sales DashboardProject Brief: 122Dataset: A proper relational dataset provided as multiple CSVs or a small database (e.g., Fact_Sales, Dim_Product, Dim_Customer, Dim_Date).5Task 1 (Model): Load all tables. In the Model View, manually create the relationships to build a perfect Star Schema. Disable "Autodetect." 58Task 2 (DAX): Create a 'Measures' table to house all calculations. Write 5-7 DAX measures, which must include:Total Sales (using SUMX) 83Sales YTD 99Sales PY 103Sales YoY %% of Total Category Sales (using CALCULATE and ALL) 96Task 3 (Visualize & Storytell): Build a multi-page report:Page 1 (Summary): A high-level overview with key KPIs and charts.Page 2 (Details): A detailed breakdown page.Configure Drill-through from the summary chart on Page 1 to the detail on Page 2.110Use Bookmarks and buttons on Page 1 to toggle the visuals between a "Sales" view and a "Profit" view.49Implement Conditional Formatting on a table to show all negative profit values in red.115Include one AI Visual (e.g., Key Influencers) to explain "Total Profit." 55Learning Outcome: The student has demonstrated mastery of the core "Analyst" workflow. They can model relational data, write sophisticated DAX, and build a user-friendly, interactive report that tells a story.Part 3: The Power BI Master – Enterprise and AdministrationModule 12: The Power BI Service – Collaboration and DeploymentLesson 12.1: Publishing and Exploring the Power BI ServiceConcept: Using the "Publish" button in Power BI Desktop to send the .pbix file to the cloud (Power BI Service).51Discussion: A tour of the Service UI, identifying the three main content types: Workspaces, Reports, and Semantic Models (the new name for Datasets).126Lesson 12.2: Reports vs. Dashboards (A Critical Distinction)Concept: In the Power BI Service, Reports and Dashboards are distinct, and the terms are not interchangeable. A Dashboard is a feature unique to the Service.10Discussion:Report: The multi-page, interactive analysis created in Power BI Desktop and published (e.g., the .pbix file).128 Reports are for deep-dive analysis.Dashboard: A single-page monitoring tool created in the Service.126 Visuals (or "tiles") are "pinned" from one or more reports to create a "greatest hits" collection or high-level summary.126 Dashboards are for high-level monitoring.129This is a common point of confusion. A "Master" must educate stakeholders on the difference to set proper expectations.129Table: Reports vs. Dashboards (in Power BI Service) 128FeatureReportDashboardSource1 report = 1 .pbix fileTiles can come from many reports 126PagesCan have many pages 128Single page only 129InteractivityHighly interactive (cross-filtering)Less interactive (clicking tile links to report)Use CaseDeep-dive Analysis 128At-a-glance Monitoring 129Lesson 12.3: Collaboration with WorkspacesConcept: A Workspace is the fundamental unit of collaboration in the Power BI Service.51Discussion: A Workspace (e.g., "Finance Team") is created, and reports are published to it. This is the "development folder" where colleagues with "Admin," "Member," or "Contributor" roles can co-create and manage content.134Lesson 12.4: Distribution with Apps (The "End-User" Experience)Concept: End-users (e.g., executives, consumers) should never be given direct access to the developer Workspace.132 The correct method for distribution is publishing the Workspace content as an App.126Discussion: An App is a clean, read-only "launcher" that bundles the reports and dashboards from a workspace into a professional, curated package for consumers.135 This hides all the backend complexity (like semantic models) and provides a much cleaner user experience.137 This is the core governance model of Power BI: Workspaces are for developers (the kitchen); Apps are for consumers (the restaurant).132 This lesson also covers other sharing methods like exporting to PDF/PPT or embedding in Microsoft Teams and SharePoint.51Table: Workspaces vs. Apps 132FeatureWorkspaceAppAudienceDevelopers, Colleagues [132]End-Users, Consumers [135]PurposeCollaboration, Development 137Distribution, Consumption 137AccessGranular roles (Admin, Member) [134]Broad, read-only (App permissions)Key ActionPublish (to workspace) [127]Publish (the app) [134]Lesson 12.5: Data Refresh and On-Premises Data GatewaysConcept: Keeping the data in an "Import" model fresh in the Power BI Service.51Discussion:Scheduled Refresh: For cloud data sources (e.g., Azure SQL, SharePoint), this can be configured in the Service. Pro licenses allow up to 8 refreshes per day; Premium allows up to 48.141On-Premises Data Gateway: If the data source is on-premise (e.g., a local SQL server), a "Gateway" must be installed on a local machine.51 This Gateway acts as a secure "tunnel," allowing the Power BI Service (in the cloud) to reach the local data and perform the refresh.143Module 13: Optimization and Performance TuningLesson 13.1: Identifying Bottlenecks with Performance AnalyzerConcept: A "Master" must build fast, efficient reports. The first step is diagnostics, using the built-in Performance Analyzer.Discussion: Found in the Optimize ribbon in Power BI Desktop.Lab: Start recording 144, interact with a slicer, and then analyze the log. The key metrics recorded for each visual are 144:DAX Query: Time spent by the DAX engine.Visual Display: Time spent by the visual rendering on-screen.Other: Time spent waiting for other visuals to complete.If "DAX Query" is slow, the DAX or Data Model is inefficient.144 If "Visual Display" is slow, the visual itself is complex or there are too many visuals on the page.Lesson 13.2: Deep-Dive Analysis with DAX StudioConcept: Performance Analyzer identifies which visual is slow. DAX Studio is a free, external tool that shows why the DAX query is slow.145Discussion: This is a "pro" tool. It can connect directly to a Power BI Desktop file.Lab: Copy a slow DAX query from Performance Analyzer 146 and paste it into DAX Studio. Run the query and analyze the "Server Timings."Discussion of Timings: The key is to look at the Formula Engine (FE) vs. Storage Engine (SE) time.147 High FE time means the DAX logic is complex. High SE time means the data model is inefficient (e.g., bad relationships, large tables). This tells the developer exactly where to focus their optimization efforts.Lesson 13.3: Core Optimization StrategiesConcept: A summary of how to fix the problems identified.76Discussion:Data Model (Highest Priority): A proper Star Schema (Module 5) is the single-best performance optimization.65Power Query: Filter data as early as possible. Remove all unneeded columns.70DAX: Write efficient DAX. Prioritize Measures over Calculated Columns (Module 6). Use DAX variables to store intermediate results.146Visuals: Reduce the number of visuals on the page. Avoid slicers with high-cardinality (e.g., 1 million distinct customers).106Lesson 13.4: Optimizing for Big Data (Aggregations)Concept: Using aggregations to pre-summarize large fact tables.Discussion: This feature allows Power BI to query a smaller, pre-aggregated table for high-level visuals (e.g., "Sales by Year") while still retaining the granular data for drill-down, offering a hybrid approach with massive performance gains.Lesson 13.5: Incremental RefreshConcept: Setting up an incremental refresh policy for large datasets.Discussion: Instead of refreshing the entire 10-year dataset every day, configure incremental refresh to only refresh the last 7 days of data, while archiving the older data. This drastically reduces refresh times and resource load.Lesson 13.6: Using Performance Analyzer in the Web (New in 2025)Concept: The Performance Analyzer tool is now also available directly in the Power BI Service (GA Oct 2025), allowing for performance testing in the production environment.Lab: Run the Performance Analyzer in the Power BI Service 144 and compare the results of a slow visual to the timings captured in Power BI Desktop.Module 14: Governance and SecurityLesson 14.1: Row-Level Security (RLS) – Static MethodConcept: RLS is a security feature that restricts data access at the row level, ensuring users only see the data they are authorized to see.148Lab (Static RLS):In Power BI Desktop, navigate to Modeling > Manage Roles.150Create a new role, e.g., Role_East.150Apply a DAX filter to the Region table:  = "East".148Test the role using the View as feature.150Publish to the Power BI Service. In the Security settings of the Semantic Model, assign users or groups to the Role_East.148Discussion: This method is simple but has high maintenance. A new role is required for every new region.148Lesson 14.2: Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS) (The "Master" Method)Concept: A scalable, enterprise-grade solution where one role dynamically filters data based on the logged-in user's identity.149Prerequisite: This method requires a "User Permissions" or "lookup" table in the data model that maps users (by their email) to the data they are allowed to see (e.g., user@company.com | East).154Lab (Dynamic RLS):Create a single role, e.g., User_Role.154Apply a DAX filter to the User Permissions table: [UserEmail] = USERPRINCIPALNAME().150Ensure the User Permissions table has a relationship to the rest of the data model (e.g., to the Dim_Region table).155Discussion: This is the superior method. Security is now data-driven. To grant a new user access, a developer doesn't change the Power BI report; an admin simply adds a row to the User Permissions table.154Lesson 14.3: Object-Level Security (OLS)Concept: RLS hides rows of data. OLS hides entire columns or tables.149Discussion: For example, hiding a `` column from "Analyst" users while making it visible to "Manager" users.Implementation: OLS cannot be configured inside the Power BI Desktop interface.157 It requires an external tool, such as Tabular Editor.157Lab: Open the model in Tabular Editor. Navigate to the `` column, find the Role_Analyst in its properties, and set the Object Level Security to "None".159Lesson 14.4: Overview of the Power BI Admin PortalConcept: A brief tour of the central, tenant-wide settings for Power BI governance.163Discussion: This includes Usage Metrics, auditing, and Tenant Settings (e.g., "Allow publish to web," "Enable external sharing," "Manage custom visuals").164 This is also where to manage data sensitivity labels, promote certified datasets, and view data lineage.Module 15: Advanced Data ModelingLesson 15.1: Introduction to Tabular Editor (External Tool)Concept: Tabular Editor is the professional's tool for data modeling. It connects to the Power BI model and exposes many properties and features not visible in the Desktop UI.157Lesson 15.2: Creating and Using Calculation GroupsConcept: Calculation Groups are the ultimate DAX reusability tool. They are, in effect, "measures for measures," allowing a developer to define calculation logic that can be applied to any base measure.161Discussion: A developer from Module 9 created , , and . They now face the task of creating , , , etc. This leads to a massive, unmanageable "measure explosion."Solution: Using Tabular Editor 161 or the new in-product tool 170, a developer creates one Calculation Group called "Time Intelligence." Inside it, they create Calculation Items like "YTD," "QTD," etc. The DAX for the "YTD" item would be TOTALYTD( SELECTEDMEASURE(), 'Date' ). The SELECTEDMEASURE() function 168 acts as a placeholder for whatever base measure is in context.167In the report, the developer uses the base measure (e.g., ) and adds the "Time Intelligence" Calculation Group as a *slicer*. When the user clicks "YTD," the  measure is dynamically wrapped by the YTD logic. This reduces dozens of measures to one base measure and one calculation group, simplifying the model dramatically.167Lesson 15.3: Advanced M Language ConceptsConcept: Moving beyond the UI in Power Query to write M code.48Discussion: A brief introduction to creating Power Query Parameters (e.g., for a server name or file path) 13 and custom M functions 46 for reusable transformation logic.Lesson 15.4: Creating Reusable ETL with Dataflows Gen2Concept: Using Power BI Dataflows (Gen2) as a cloud-based ETL tool that integrates with Microsoft Fabric.Discussion: A Dataflow is "Power Query in the cloud." It allows a developer to prepare data once in the Service, storing the clean data in Azure Data Lake. Multiple reports can then connect to this single, certified Dataflow.126 Dataflows Gen2 allows this data to be directly loaded as a destination into a Fabric Lakehouse or Warehouse.Module 16: Enterprise Deployment and IntegrationLesson 16.1: CI/CD with Deployment PipelinesConcept: A "Master" never publishes a change directly to the live production report. A professional Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow is used to de-risk changes.171Discussion: Deployment Pipelines in the Power BI Service provide a simple, visual interface for this.171Lab:Create three Workspaces: Finance_DEV, Finance_TEST, and Finance_PROD.173Create a new Deployment Pipeline and assign these workspaces to the Development, Test, and Production stages.171Publish the .pbix file from Desktop to the Finance_DEV workspace.In the pipeline, click "Deploy to Test".171 This copies the content.A colleague (QA) reviews the report in the Finance_TEST environment.After approval, the developer clicks "Deploy to Prod".171 This updates the live report for end-users.This process ensures that a broken report is never visible to end-users.6 The pipeline also supports deployment rules (e.g., automatically changing a database connection from the DEV database to the PROD database).173Lesson 16.2: The Future: Microsoft Fabric and OneLakeConcept: Power BI is no longer just a standalone tool; it is the visualization experience for Microsoft Fabric.10Discussion: Fabric is Microsoft's new, all-in-one analytics platform.10 It unifies Data Engineering (Data Factory, Spark), Data Warehousing (SQL), and Business Intelligence (Power BI) into a single SaaS product.10The central concept is OneLake.21 OneLake is the "OneDrive for Data." All Fabric tools read from and write to this single, unified data lake. This eliminates data duplication, silos, and the need for constant data movement. The "Master" developer must understand this shift: the future is less about "importing files" and more about "connecting to the OneLake."Lesson 16.3: Integrating with the Power Platform (Power Apps & Power Automate)Concept: Making reports actionable by integrating with the other components of the Power Platform.12Discussion:Power Apps: Embed a Power App inside a Power BI report.178 This allows users to write back to the data source. For example, a user sees a sales record that is incorrect and can submit a correction from within the report itself.180Power Automate: Trigger an automated workflow from a Power BI report.178 For example, a button on the report that says "Email this analysis to my team".181Lesson 16.4: Developer Focus: Power BI Embedded AnalyticsConcept: For "Master" level developers, this is the process of embedding Power BI content inside their own custom applications for external customers (a SaaS scenario).182Discussion: This is a highly technical, API-driven 184 topic. It involves App Registration in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), workspace management, and using client-side APIs (JavaScript) to render the content securely.182Lesson 16.5: Introduction to Streaming and Real-Time DashboardsConcept: A brief overview of connecting to streaming data sources (e.g., IoT sensor data via Azure Stream Analytics).10Discussion: This illustrates how Power BI can be used for real-time analytics, moving beyond static, refreshed reports.NEW Module 17: Copilot & Fabric Mastery (2025 Features)Lesson 17.1: Introduction to Copilot (The AI Assistant)Concept: Using the new Copilot pane to summarize reports and generate insights using natural language.Lab: Use the Copilot pane to "Summarize sales trends" on a report page and ask follow-up questions about the data.Lesson 17.2: Copilot for DAX Generation (GA Oct 2025)Concept: Using Copilot in the DAX Query View to write and explain complex DAX measures from a natural language prompt.Lab: In the DAX Query View, prompt Copilot to "Write a DAX query for YoY growth" and then ask it to "Explain this query" to understand the code.Lesson 17.3: Copilot for Report BuildingConcept: Using Copilot's natural language capabilities to generate full, multi-page reports from a high-level prompt.Lab: Prompt Copilot to "Create a report page showing sales by region and category" and refine the visuals it produces.Lesson 17.4: Fabric Integration: The OneLake ShortcutConcept: Connecting a Power BI semantic model directly to data in a Fabric Lakehouse using a "OneLake shortcut," eliminating data movement and enabling a single source of truth.Lab: In a Fabric Lakehouse, create a shortcut to an external data source. Then, connect to this Lakehouse from Power BI Desktop and build a report.Capstone Project 3: Advanced-Level Portfolio ProjectProject Brief: 55Task: This is a self-directed, portfolio-worthy project where the student must create an end-to-end solution from scratch.Domain Choice: The student can choose a complex domain, such as Healthcare Claims Fraud 55, Global Supply Chain Analysis 55, HR Analytics 190, Sales & Marketing 187, or Finance Analytics.190Requirements (Must Include):Complex Data Model: Must source data from multiple, messy files and build an optimized Star Schema.Advanced DAX: Must include Time Intelligence measures and at least one other complex pattern (e.g., Calculation Groups 167 or complex CALCULATE filters 95).Security: Must implement Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS).155Storytelling: Must use Bookmarks, Drill-through, or Custom Tooltips to create a guided narrative.113Performance: The student must use the Performance Analyzer 144 to identify one performance bottleneck and document the steps taken to fix it (e.g., "My bar chart was slow, Perf Analyzer showed high DAX query time, I fixed it by...").AI/Fabric Integration: The report must be connected to a Fabric Lakehouse and include a Copilot-generated narrative summary explaining the key insights.Deliverable: A published Power BI report (or App) and a 5-minute video presentation where the student "walks through" their report, explaining the insights, the narrative, and the advanced technical features (like RLS and Copilot) they implemented.Learning Outcome: The student has proven they are a "Master." They can successfully manage a complex BI project from ingestion to deployment, implement enterprise-grade security, tune for performance, and—most importantly—communicate the value of their work.Module 18: Certification & CareerLesson 18.1: Certification: The PL-300 ExamConcept: The PL-300 is the official "Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst" certification.12Discussion: This entire course has been structured to align with the key domains of the PL-300 exam: Prepare data (Power Query), Model data (Star Schema, DAX), Visualize data (Reports, Storytelling), and Deploy and maintain assets (Service, Governance).191PL-300 Skills Mapping:PL-300 Section%Curriculum CoveragePrepare Data25-30Part 1 (Modules 2-3)Model Data25-30Part 2 (Modules 5-9, 15)Visualize Data25-30Part 1 (Module 4), Part 2 (Modules 10-11)Manage/Secure15-20Part 3 (Modules 12, 13, 14, 16)Lesson 18.2: Learning Paths by RoleConcept: "Mastery" can take many forms, and the next steps depend on career goals.190Discussion: How to apply these skills in specialized roles:BI Analyst: Double-down on DAX, Modeling, and Data Storytelling.190Data Engineer: Focus on advanced Power Query (M), Dataflows Gen2, and Microsoft Fabric.176BI Developer: Specialize in Power BI Embedded, CI/CD, and Governance.184Lesson 18.3: Staying Current (The Power BI Monthly Update)Concept: Power BI changes every single month.Discussion: Mastery is not a final destination; it is a process of continuous learning. The most important skill is "learning how to learn." This lesson will point students to the critical resources for staying current: the official Microsoft Power BI Blog, key community YouTube channels 7, and community forums.Lesson 18.4: Downloadable Resources and Cheat-SheetsConcept: Providing students with downloadable datasets, solution files (.pbix), and quick-reference "cheat sheets."Discussion: This includes a DAX formula reference, a Power Query M tips sheet, and a visualization design checklist to support continued learning and on-the-job application.Lesson 18.5: Final Deliverable: Your LinkedIn PortfolioConcept: How to present the three capstone projects and your PL-300 certification badge on your professional profile to attract employers.
